##Crystal Collector

This is the fourth assignment for the Vandebilt-based Trilogy Coding Bootcamp.

For this assignment, we created an interactive game for web browsers. The app dynamically updates the HTML commands with the jQuery library.

####Getting Started

###Crystal Collector

####Instructions:

The user will be given a random number to start the game.
Four crystals can be seen on the page, each labeled with a number (1 through 4).  To start the game, the player selects and clicks on any of the four crystals. Each crystal will add some specific amount of points to the total score, but this specific value is hidden, and unknown until that crystal is selected.  The point count for each crystal remains the same during each game, then randomly changes at the start of the next game. The game is won when the sum of the player's selected crystals matches the target value shown at the start.  If the total score exceeds the target number, it counts as a loss. 
A running tally of wins and losses is shown on the screen.
